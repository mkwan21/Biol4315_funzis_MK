## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r vegan, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("vegan")
```

ggplot2 will now be installed.  After it is installed a scatter plot will be made from the cars dataset.

```{r ggplot2, echo = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")
```

```{r scatterplot, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + geom_point()
```
